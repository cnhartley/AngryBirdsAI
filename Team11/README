Usage and Implementations:
--------------------------
To use this distribution for the Angry Birds AI agent to play Angry Birds 
through the Google Chrome extensions provided by AIBirds.org, use the jar file
team11.jar to load and execute your implementation of the Team11Agent class.
The Team11Agent class is found in the team11.core.agent package.

Note: Your implementation of the agent must override the doTurn(Vision) method.

Compiling:
----------
In order to compile an implementation with this jar file, use the follow:

%> javac -classpath team11.jar [theAgent.java]

Executing:
----------
To execute an implementation of this jar file, use the following:

%> java -jar team11.jar -d -a [theAgent.class] -l log.txt -s

As a side note; the jar file is an executable jar, thus not requiring the java 
-jar command. However, if running it in this manner the debug output and error 
output will not be displayed in the terminal and instead recorded in the 
systems logs.

%> team11.jar -a [theAgent.class] -l log.txt -s


Example:
[file system]
    folder
      +-- team11
      |     +-- agent
      |           +-- MyAgent.class          // Must extend the Team11Agent!
      +-- team11.jar
      +-- log.txt
[command prompt]
%folder> java -jar team11.jar -d -a team11\agent\MyAgent.class -l log.txt -s

This turns ON debugging with the "-d", or "--debug", parameter, loads the
specified agent with the "-a", or "--agent" parameter and sets the log file to
be used with the "-l", or "--log" parameter. The "-s", or "--show" parameter 
displays the debugging screen capture frame.

Command-Line Parameters:
------------------------
This application requires command-line parameters to load and initialize the 
various components to run an implementation of the AI agent. The list for 
available command-line options and parameters follows:

Option(s)	Function(s)
-a --agent [path]	 Required to specify your implementation of the agent which 
                   must extend the Team11Agent.
-d --debug	       [optional] Sets the debugging for the agent to print out all
                   debugging information when calling the internal
                   team11.core.agent.Team11Agent#debug(String) Team11Agent#debug
                   (String) method. Default the debugging is set to false; not
                   to print.
-h --help	       [optional] If present, all other parameters are ignored and 
                   the usage for the jar file is printed to standard output, 
                   System.out.
-l --log [path]	 [optional] Sets the log file to be appended to when calling 
                   the internal team11.core.agent.Team11Agent#log(String) 
                   Team11Agent#log(String) method. Default prints to System.out.
-s --show	       [optional] Shows the debugging screen capture frame.
