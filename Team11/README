Usage and Implementations:
--------------------------
To use this distribution for the Angry Birds AI agent to play Angry Birds 
through the Google Chrome extensions provided by AIBirds.org, use the jar file
team11.jar to load and execute your implementation of the Team11Agent class.
The Team11Agent class is found in the team11.core.agent package.

Note: Your implementation of the agent must override the doTurn(Vision) method.
 
From a command prompt, type the following;

 %> java -jar team11.jar -d -a [path to your agent] -l [path to your log file]

This turns ON debugging with the "-d", or "--debug", parameter, loads the
specified agent with the "-a", or "--agent" parameter and sets the log file to
be used with the "-l", or "--log" parameter.

Example:
[file system]
    root_folder
      +-- team11
      |     +-- agent
      |           +-- MyAgent.class          // Must extend the Team11Agent!
      +-- team11.jar
      +-- log.txt
[command prompt]
%root_folder> java -jar team11.jar -d -a team11\agent\MyAgent.class -l log.txt

Options for team11.jar:
-----------------------
  -a  --agent   Required to specify your implementation of the agent which must
                extend the team11.core.agent.Team11Agent.
  -d  --debug   [optional] Sets the debugging for the agent to print out all 
                debugging information when calling the internal debug(String) 
                method. Default the debugging is set to false; not to print.
  -h  --help    [optional] If present, all other parameters are ignored and the
                usage for the jar file is printed to standard output.
  -l  --log     [optional] Sets the log file to be appended to when calling the
                internal log(String) method. Default prints to System.out.
